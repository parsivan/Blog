# Why Hugo + Obsidian
 I have been wanting to create a blog for a long time and i even started using free WordPress but i knew that is not a solution i want. 
 
 I had heard of Hugo before from some random person i interacted with on linked in after finding their Hugo blog they were hosting in Netlify. but i was unsure how i am supposed to use it, or at least what is the best way to use Hugo that would be easiest and most efficient. Since i didn't want to use a browser every time i want to write something; I wanted it to be seamless.

Until I saw network chuck video about Hugo.

## Network Chuck
He has been a great model role for best practices.  In this new video that as of now has been uploaded 13 days ago he mentions how important taking notes of ideas is. 

I have been doing that for better of several months. I stopped a few weeks ago but as someone with ADHD it brings peace of mind to me. So i couldn't agree more on how much improves my life in general.
