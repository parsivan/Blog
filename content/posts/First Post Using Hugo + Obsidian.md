# Why Hugo + Obsidian
 I have been wanting to create a blog for a long time and i even started using free WordPress but i knew that is not a solution i want. 
 
 I had heard of Hugo before from [Axel Bock](https://linkedin.con/axelbock). I interacted with him on linked in after finding his Hugo blog. I didn't know what Hugo is or how am I supposed to use it. I remembered my blog from my teenager days and i really didn't like it. I also tried Blogger and WordPress. they are very limiting. It is very limiting that I have to do all the writing and editing in the website and even then that is not fun to do because you don't get much freedom in making what you like.

Until I saw network chuck video about Hugo.

## Network Chucks way
He has been a great model role for best practices.  In this new video that as of now has been uploaded 13 days ago he mentions how important taking notes of ideas is. 

I have been taking daily notes for better of several months. I try to keep it a daily thing but It is sometimes I skip for a few days. As someone with ADHD it brings peace and quiet to my brain. I would suggest others to get into the habit of note taking as well.

I my self started with a yellow LEUCHTTURM 1917 pocket size. Another reason i like taking notes is that your ideas will be physically available and you can go back to them. I myself forget my ideas easily.

The reason I started the blog is because i do a lot of Learning & Researching on different Topics but whenever I return to revisit or use that knowledge I would have to back track a lot of things because i usually forget important parts.

This reminds me of that time where i wanted to start a moded minecraft server using mineos. The OS was tricky to use and was not straight forward for mod servers and I fixed it after 3-4 days of research and experimenting.  Then next year I wanted to start a server again but i didn't remembered what i did.

Documenting your thoughts and actions saves the day. not only for you but maybe others as well.
