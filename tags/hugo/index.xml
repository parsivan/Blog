      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;why-hugo--obsidian&#34;&gt;Why Hugo + Obsidian&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have been wanting to create a blog for a long time and i even started using free WordPress but i knew that is not a solution i want.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had heard of Hugo before from some random person i interacted with on linked in after finding their Hugo blog they were hosting in Netlify. but i was unsure how i am supposed to use it, or at least what is the best way to use Hugo that would be easiest and most efficient. Since i didn&amp;rsquo;t want to use a browser every time i want to write something; I wanted it to be seamless.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
